## Testing

Comprehensive testing framework with 81 tests covering:

```bash
npm test              # Watch mode development
npm run test:run      # Single run for CI/CD
npm run test:ui       # Visual test interface
npm run test:coverage # Coverage reporting
```

- **Unit Tests** (29) - Utility functions and business logic
- **Component Tests** (38) - UI components and interactions
- **Integration Tests** (8) - Data flow and filtering workflows
- **End-to-End Tests** (5) - Complete user scenarios

## üöÄ Deployment & Distribution

### Automated Releases
The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases:

- **Automatic Builds** - Every push to main triggers a Windows build
- **Release Creation** - Tagged releases automatically generate installer executables
- **Artifact Upload** - Built installers are automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases

### Manual Deployment

#### Desktop Application (Recommended)
```sh
# Build the desktop application
npm run build-electron

# Or create distributable installer
npm run dist
```

#### Web Application
```sh
# Build web version for static hosting
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory and can be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Release Process

#### Automated Installer Creation
To create a new release with installer:

1. **Update Version Numbers**
   ```bash
   # Update version in package.json (both main version and extraMetadata)
   npm version patch  # or minor/major
   ```

2. **Commit Version Changes**
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Bump version to v1.x.x for release"
   ```

3. **Create and Push Release Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.x.x
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.x.x
   ```

4. **Monitor GitHub Actions**
   - Check [Actions tab](https://github.com/vacuumboots/device-glance-dashboard/actions) for build progress
   - Build creates Windows installer (.exe) automatically
   - Installer uploaded to [Releases page](https://github.com/vacuumboots/device-glance-dashboard/releases)

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow:
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, version tags (v*), or manual dispatch
- **Builds**: Windows executable with electron-builder
- **Uploads**: Installer files to GitHub Releases for version tags
- **Duration**: ~5-10 minutes for complete build and upload
